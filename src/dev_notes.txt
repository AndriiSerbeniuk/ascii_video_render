So ideally the image should be rendered into some set range of characters.
These characters should probably be set by a config of sorts. A variable will do for now.

The image should be converted to grayscale (and blurred?), divided into smaller manageable chunks (this will be the resolution of the rendered text),
and each chunk should be converted into a character, based on how dark it is.
A character set should contain charaters sorted based on what brightness value they should represent, with the first character having brightness value of 0,
and the last one - 255.
Brightness values of middle characters will be spread evenly, based on their quantity.

The final image will be just printed to console for now.
